Ocean Man
Take me by the hand, lead me to the land
that you understand
Ocean Man
The voyage to the corner of the globe is a real trip
Ocean Man
The crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
Ocean Man
Can you see through the wonder of amazement
Of the oberman?
Ocean Man
The crust is elusive when it casts fourth
To the child-like man
Ocean Man
The sequence of a life form braised in the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
Ocean Man
...
Ocean Man
Take me by the hand, lead me to the land
That you understand
Ocean Man 
The voyage to the corner of the globe is a real trip
